### 1.0.1
- Removed the md5 hash approach as the hashtag prefix. This approach hurts the invalidation update badly. Also we chose the md5 approach since we didnâ€™t know how to generate invalidator key on update/delete query. But that problem is already solved, we know how to generator the invalidator key correctly therefore md5 approach is no longer suitable
- Moved the lua/cache_thing.lua script to python to use the cluster feature
- Update cluster/invalidation.py to improve invalidation speed by replace the old approach with newer one
- No longer need prefix to distribute the redis key. It should be evenly distributed now
